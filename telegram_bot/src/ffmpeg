This is a placeholder for the FFmpeg binary.
In a real deployment, this file would be a static build of FFmpeg
compatible with the AWS Lambda execution environment (Amazon Linux 2).
You can download a suitable build from sources like:
https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/
Make sure to make the binary executable (chmod +x ffmpeg) before deploying.
