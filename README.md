# **EchoBridge: Technical Documentation Suite**

## **Project Overview**

### **1.0 Project Vision: "EchoBridge"**

This document suite outlines the architecture and implementation plan for **EchoBridge**, a service designed to create a seamless communication channel between the Telegram messaging platform and Amazon's Alexa ecosystem. The project's core vision is to bridge the gap between the immediate, text-based interactions of a personal messaging application and the ambient, voice-first environment of smart home devices.

EchoBridge will empower users to receive notifications and listen to voice messages sent via a dedicated Telegram bot directly on their Alexa-enabled devices, such as the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot. This creates a powerful new paradigm for personal alerts and asynchronous voice communication within the home.

### **2.0 Core Features**

The EchoBridge service is defined by the following key features:

* **Secure Account Linking:** The system will employ the industry-standard OAuth 2.0 protocol to securely link a user's Telegram identity with their Amazon Alexa account. This process ensures that user credentials for either platform are never handled, stored, or exposed by the EchoBridge service, directly addressing the paramount requirement for security and privacy.
* **Text Message Notifications:** When a user receives a text message via the EchoBridge Telegram bot, the service will trigger a non-intrusive notification on all of the user's registered Echo devices. This notification manifests as the familiar yellow light ring, which the user can then query at their convenience by asking, "Alexa, what are my notifications?" This functionality is powered by the Alexa Proactive Events API, ensuring a native and familiar user experience.
* **Voice Message Playback:** Users can send voice notes to the EchoBridge Telegram bot. The service will process these audio files and make them available for playback on the user's Alexa devices. This feature leverages Alexa's AudioPlayer interface to stream the audio, providing a seamless listening experience as if it were a native audio source.

### **3.0 High-Level Technology Stack**

The EchoBridge service will be built upon a modern, serverless architecture hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to ensure scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency.

* **Cloud Platform:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* **Compute:** AWS Lambda for all backend logic, providing a serverless, event-driven execution environment.
* **API Layer:** Amazon API Gateway to create, publish, and secure APIs for service-to-service communication.
* **Authentication:** AWS Cognito will serve as the OAuth 2.0 provider, managing user identities and the secure account linking process.
* **Storage:** Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) for the secure, temporary storage of processed voice message files.
* **Voice Platform:** Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) for the development and configuration of the custom Alexa Skill.
* **Messaging Platform:** Telegram Bot API for user interaction and message reception.
